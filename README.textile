h1. Responsivepx

This is a tweaked version of @rem's awesome responsivepx tool ("https://github.com/remy/responsivepx":https://github.com/remy/responsivepx, live service at "http://responsivepx.com":http://responsivepx.com).

Added features:

* Support for manual creation of predefined resolution values
** Saved to localStorage, so they are preserved between page loads (note: doesn't work in Firefox if loaded as a local file)
** Switch easily between the saved presets using Ctrl+[LeftArrow|RightArrow]
